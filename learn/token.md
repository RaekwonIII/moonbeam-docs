# Introduction

As a decentralized smart contract platform, Moonbeam requires a utility token to function.  

This token is central to the design of Moonbeam and cannot be removed without sacrificing essential functionality. The Moonbeam token uses include:

 - Supporting the gas metering of smart contract execution
 - Incentivizing collators and powering the mechanics around the creation of a decentralized node infrastructure on which the platform can run
 - Facilitating the on-chain governance mechanism, including proposing referenda, electing council members, voting, etc.
 - Paying for network transaction fees

## Glimmer Token

The token for the Moonbeam deployment on Polkadot MainNet will be called Glimmer, as in, “that smart contract call will cost 3 Glimmer.”  The token symbol will be GLMR.

You can find more information about Glimmer [here](https://moonbeam.foundation/glimmer-token/).

## Moonriver Token

The token for the Moonbeam deployment on Kusama (called Moonriver) will be called Moonriver, as in, “that smart contract call will cost 3 Moonriver.”  The token symbol will be MOVR.

You can find more information about Moonriver [here](https://moonbeam.foundation/moonriver-token/).

## Moonshadow Token

The token for the Moonbeam deployment on Westend (called Moonshadow) will be called Moonshadow, as in, “that smart contract call will cost 3 Moonshadow.”  The token symbol will be MSHD.

This token can be acquired freely and **it has no value**, as its only purpose is to drive development and testing on Moonshadow.

More information about how to freely acquire MSHD will follow soon.

## DEV Token

In our Moonbeam TestNet (called Moonbase Alpha), the token is called DEV. This token can be acquired freely and **it has no value**, as its only purpose is to drive development and testing on Moonbase Alpha.

You can acquire DEV tokens for free from our [faucet](https://docs.moonbeam.network/getting-started/testnet/faucet/).
